# National Debt Trends
The below chart shows trends in debt-to-GDP ratios for 35 countries between 1995 and 2019.

# Japan As An Outlier
 In this dataset, one of the clearest stories around national debt occurs in Japan. After the turn of the 21st century, you can see below that Japan pulls away from the rest of the countries and has incurred national debt in greater amounts (in comparison to GDP) and at a faster rate than other countries in the OECD data set.

# Comparing The Visualizations
To begin, each of these visualizations has a different purpose. To start, the top visualization from the [OECD General Government Det data set](/https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-debt.htm) isolates one year of data. This is useful if you're trying to compare amount of debt (based on ratio to GDP) only. This first visualization also is not spectacularly interesting to look at, nor does it tell a particular story; however, it's easy to read and fine for what it is. The second visualization from Flourish essentially adds time (greater number of years) as a story-telling element. For each of the 35 countries, you can see how their debt-to-GDP ratio changes over time, and to some degree, you can also see how different countries compare in debt ratio overall and accumulation of debt over time. That said, because of the eye movement required to review 35 individual grids, this visualization does make it more difficult for the viewer to conduct a nuanced analysis of how countries compare in overal debt ratio and accumulation of debt over time. Finally, the last one I made shares the specific story that stuck out most to me when working with this OECD data set: that Japan is an outlier, both in terms of debt-to-GDP ratio and how quickly it continues to accumulate debt over time.
  
In order to tell this story in my third visualization, I choose a line graph so that I could display the debt-to-GDP ratio on a spectrum of time. I also knew, by looking at the other visualizations, that the lines of the other countries besides Japan would eventually form a tight visual cluster, which would make Japan's departure from the average more clear to the viewer. In many cases, too-tight line graphs might be a bad thing, but given that the other countries (besides Japan) are a grouped variable signified by the grey color, I think it visually works. Japan is also highlighted in red to make it the first thing that the viewer sees. Finally, I added the x-axis annotation at the mark of the beginning of the 21st Century, because once the data is visualized in this line graph, it becomes clear that Japan only started to noticeably pull away from the rest of the pack after the year 2000.
