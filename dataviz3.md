I chose this particular table because, as an arts management student and someone currently working in arts advocacy, data quantifying economic impact of the arts by location is crucial to both arts advovacy and market analysis for new organizations or programs. Unfortunately, while this data is both accurate and useful, the table format makes it difficult to digest quickly. Additionally, while quantifying the total value of the arts/culture industry is helpful (first column), when individual state values are compared to the whole, only California appears to make up a significant portion of the whole $804.2 billion national figure. As it stands, this column of data doesn't do much for the story of how quickly these states are growing in comparison to the two furthest right columns.  
# The Process
### Gleaning from Critique Process
The Critique process helped me identify what the strengths and limitations of the original table format, and thus helped me identify what I wanted to keep, scrap, and emphasize. The original table is complete, accurate, and tables are generally intuitive to read. I thus did not want to lose any of the strengths of how the data was originally visualized in the table. I did, however, want to make this data more aesthetically pleasing, engaging, and more quickly perceptable. In the original table, it's not easy to perceive how each states' data compares to the others, nor is it easy to perceive how the data in the fourth and fifth columns relates to the U.S. average. The data also isn't aesthetically pleasing or engaging, so I believed changing the chart type and color could improve that. Finally, arts managers might notice looking at this list that the fastest growing states aren't necessarily what we'd assume they might be. The states were also clustered in two major geographic areas, so I decided that it was important to the story to visualize where these states were on a map.
