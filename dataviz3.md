I chose this particular table because, as an arts management student and someone currently working in arts advocacy, data quantifying economic impact of the arts by location is crucial to both arts advovacy and market analysis for new organizations or programs. Unfortunately, while this data is both accurate and useful, the table format makes it difficult to digest quickly. Additionally, while quantifying the total value of the arts/culture industry is helpful (first column), when individual state values are compared to the whole, only California appears to make up a significant portion of the whole $804.2 billion national figure. As it stands, this column of data doesn't do much for the story of how quickly these states are growing in comparison to the two other columns.  
# The Process
The Critique process helped me identify what the strengths and limitations of the original table format, and thus helped me identify what I wanted to keep, scrap, and emphasize.
